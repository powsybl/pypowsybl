    Connects an existing voltage level to an existing line through a tee point.

    Connects an existing voltage level (in practice a voltage level where we have some loads or generations)
    to an existing line through a tee point. This method cuts an existing line in two, creating a fictitious
    voltage level between them (on a fictitious substation if asked).
    Then it links an existing voltage level to this fictitious voltage level by creating a new line
    described in the provided dataframe.

    Args:
        network: the network
        df: attributes as a dataframe, it should contain:
            bbs_or_bus_id: the ID of the existing bus or bus bar section of the voltage level voltage_level_id.
            new_line_id: ID of the new line
            new_line_r: resistance of the new line, in ohms
            new_line_x: reactance of the new line, in ohms
            new_line_b1: shunt susceptance on side 1 of the new line
            new_line_b2: shunt susceptance on side 2 of the new line
            new_line_g1: shunt conductance on side 1 of the new line
            new_line_g2: shunt conductance on side 2 of the new line
            line_id: the id on of the line on which we want to create a tee point.
            line1_id: when the initial line is cut, the line segment at side 1 has a given ID (optional).
            line1_name: when the initial line is cut, the line segment at side 1 has a given name (optional).
            line2_id: when the initial line is cut, the line segment at side 2 has a given ID (optional).
            line2_name: when the initial line is cut, the line segment at side 2 has a given name (optional).
            position_percent: when the existing line is cut in two lines, percent is equal to the ratio between the parameters of the first line
                        and the parameters of the line that is cut multiplied by 100. 100 minus percent is equal to the ratio
                        between the parameters of the second line and the parameters of the line that is cut multiplied by 100.
            create_fictitious_substation: True to create the fictitious voltage level inside a fictitious substation (false by default).
            fictitious_voltage_level_id: the ID of the fictitious voltage level (optional) containing the tee point.
            fictitious_voltage_level_name: the name of the fictitious voltage level (optional) containing the tee point.
            fictitious_substation_id: the ID of the fictitious substation (optional).
            fictitious_substation_name: the name of the fictitious substation (optional).
        raise_exception: optionally, whether the calculation should throw exceptions. In any case, errors will
         be logged. Default is False.
        reporter: optionally, the reporter to be used to create an execution report, default is None (no report).
                    bbs_or_bus_id: the ID of the existing bus or bus bar section of the voltage level voltage_level_id.

    Creates a transformer and connects it to buses or busbar sections through standard feeder bays.

    In node/breaker topology, the created bays are composed of one breaker, and one disconnector for each busbar section
    parallel to the section specified in arguments. Only the disconnector on the specified
    section is closed, others are left open.

    In bus/breaker topology, the transformer is simply connected to the buses.

    Args:
        network: the network to which we want to add the new line
        df: Attributes as a dataframe.
        raise_exception: optionally, whether the calculation should throw exceptions. In any case, errors will
         be logged. Default is False.
        reporter: optionally, the reporter to be used to create an execution report, default is None (no report).
        kwargs: Attributes as keyword arguments.

    Notes:

        The input dataframe expects same attributes as :meth:`Network.create_2_windings_transformers`, except for the
        additional following attributes:

        - **bus_or_busbar_section_id_1**: the identifier of the bus or of the busbar section on side 1
        - **position_order_1**: in node/breaker topology, the position of the transformer on side 1
        - **direction_1**: optionally, in node/breaker, the direction, TOP or BOTTOM, of the transformer on side 1
        - **bus_or_busbar_section_id_2**: the identifier of the bus or of the busbar section on side 2
        - **position_order_2**: in node/breaker, the position of the transformer on side 2
