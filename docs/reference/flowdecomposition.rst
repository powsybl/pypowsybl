Flow decomposition
==================

.. module:: pypowsybl.flowdecomposition

The flow decomposition module allows to decompose active flows on cross-border relevant network element with contingency (XNEC) based on the ACER methodology.  
This python interface is based on the java implementation in the `PowSyBl ENTSO-E repository <https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-entsoe>`_.  

This simple version of flow decomposition will evolve with next versions of flow decomposition Java version.  
Here are the assumptions that we made:

- no contingency management  
- XNEC = interconnection branch or 5% zonal PTDF method  
- zone = country  
- country GSK  
- no HVDC management  

Run a flow decomposition
------------------------

You can run a flow decomposition using the following methods:

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:
   :toctree: api/

    run

Parameters
----------

The execution of the flowdecomposition can be customized using flowdecomposition parameters.

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:

    Parameters

.. include it in the toctree
.. toctree::
   :hidden:

   flowdecomposition/parameters

Some enum classes are used in parameters:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api/
   :template: autosummary/class_without_members.rst
